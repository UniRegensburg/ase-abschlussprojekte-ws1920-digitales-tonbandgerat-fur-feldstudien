# Audidroid

The recording of audio is a tried and tested method in scientific research. The usual downside of this is the relatively intensive postprocessing of audio files. Interviews, for example, can contain very different information and subject areas. Further, annotations are usually separated from the original recording, which makes it difficult to efficiently organize bigger collections of recordings.

To make these tasks more bearable, Audidroid was developed to connect metadata directly to the recording audio. At its core, the app focuses on recording and saving audio files. But what makes Audidroid unique are the possibilities of marking important and interesting points in a recording, appending general information to files, and organizing the created collection. The user should be able to configure these annotations to their personal preferences.

Through these methods, the organization and usage of audio files should be made more efficient and usable.

## Users

On the one hand, Audidroid can just be used to create and share audio recordings of any kind, and further as a tool to organize those recordings. The intuitive design of the app enables this functionality to all users.

On the other hand, Audidroid shines the most if its advanced features are used in a scientific and research context. Interviews and voice notes can be saved, organized, played back, annotated and edited, all directly within the app. This can not only be used by researchers and students conducting user-based research, but also in other branches like psychotherapy, where the analysis of conversations is vital.  

In general, the app is made for students, researchers, and interviewers, who want to quickly annotate recorded audio. This allows for efficient organization and postprocessing, enabling a fast and reliable workflow.

## Features / Use Cases

Using Audidroid, users are able to quickly and easily record audio files. During recording, it is possible to highlight important and interesting points, thereby annotating recordings on the fly. After that, users can choose a filename, a storage location, and configurable labels to save their recordings. This, along with the options to create folders, search, filter and sort recordings makes it easy to keep all files organized. The recordings can be played back, and it is possible to skip to the previously marked points. Another feature is editing files right in the app. Users are able to trim and cut recordings, as well as editing labels, marks, and even attaching comments to specific marks. Lastly, files can be shared to other apps, and converted to other audio file formats before that.

## Data source

The app has no need for external data sources, as the files get saved and processed locally on the Android device.
